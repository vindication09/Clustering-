# Clustering-
Prerequisite "Foundations of Analytics" 

This course is going to focus on the topic of clustering. Users should have taken the Analytics Foundations Course https://github.com/vindication09/Data-Science-Mathematics or similar. Some familiarty with Python is required. The purpose of this training session is to learn the concept of clustering and see how to apply it to real world data sets. 

The purpose of the course is to prepare course takers to learn the basics of clustering techniques in addition to clustering in the context of basic social network analysis. Eventually we will work our way to learn the language and concepts required for using BigClam https://snap.stanford.edu/snap/description.html
